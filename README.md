# CalendlyAI(Name yet to be confirmed) 
This is the dev branch for the CalendlyAI web app. Hoping to take this into production by Feb-15,2024.
## What this project is
The goal of this project is to combine the power of LLMs and Google's API to give students the little boost they 
need in the beginning of every semester.

In the begining of every semester students spend a good chunk of their time going through the outline of their courses
and setting up a Google calendar around the import dates. The goal of this project is to automate that entire process.

Hopefully we can get this project to a stage where we can think of possibly adding some paid features such as if you 
want to use this app for multiple subjects etc.

Main goal for now is to get the project production ready ASAP

A basic architecture of the app can be found here: https://app.eraser.io/workspace/4X0zgxPhtUJXdt3BXzoE?origin=share
## Tech Stack
This app uses the T3 stack

## Motivation
Main motivation of this project came from me trying to learn some full stack development. I wanted to work on a project
that helped me learn full stack but also possible make something usefull.

Hoping to involve a group of people in this project so that this can be a collaborative project and a space for all of 
us to become better developers
## Basis Rules
None yet. Just want to get the job done and make sure the user experience is smooth.
